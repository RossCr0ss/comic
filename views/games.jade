											| Originally created for the GitHub Game-off 2013, this game takes you on an epic
											| journey through the frog lifecycle. Start as a tadpole, grabbing food
											| and avoiding other tadpoles. Also, fish try to eat you. The goal
											| is to become a frog as fast as possible.
										p
											| After achieving frogginess, you try to jump frogs back into the pond. As the clock
											| ticks down, aim for lily pads and catch bugs for more time.
										p
											| You'll have to play this one on a "real" computer, as it is
											| not mobile-friendly at this time. I'm really sorry about that.
